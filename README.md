# MAP_FRONTEND_CHALLENGE

## Introduction
This is a simple frontend project created using React. Here, I have created a horizontally scrollable component that contains 20 different cards, created a json file where properties of the cards are defined. Added some smooth animations for interactive buttons, scroll effects and also added skeleton loading.
